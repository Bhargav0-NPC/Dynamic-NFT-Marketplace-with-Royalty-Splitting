# Dynamic NFT Marketplace with Royalty Splitting

## Project Description

The Dynamic NFT Marketplace with Royalty Splitting is a comprehensive blockchain-based platform that revolutionizes the way Non-Fungible Tokens (NFTs) are created, traded, and managed. This smart contract system combines traditional NFT marketplace functionality with advanced features including dynamic metadata updates and sophisticated royalty distribution mechanisms.

The platform addresses key limitations in current NFT ecosystems by providing creators with the ability to update their NFT metadata post-mint, ensuring that digital assets can evolve over time. Additionally, the integrated royalty splitting system ensures fair compensation for all stakeholders involved in the creation and promotion of NFTs, including artists, collaborators, and platform contributors.

## Project Vision

Our vision is to create a more equitable and dynamic NFT ecosystem where:

- **Creators maintain control** over their digital assets even after sale through dynamic metadata capabilities
- **Fair compensation** is automatically distributed to all stakeholders through transparent royalty mechanisms  
- **Innovation is encouraged** through flexible smart contract architecture that supports evolving use cases
- **Community building** is fostered through collaborative creation and revenue sharing models
- **Long-term sustainability** is ensured through built-in marketplace fees and creator incentives

We envision this platform becoming the foundation for next-generation NFT projects that require adaptive content, collaborative creation, and fair revenue distribution.
